->Task 1:Review lab videos on C programming and RISC-V architecture. Perform the task of compiling C code using both the GCC compiler and the RISC-V compiler, demonstrating an understanding of the compilation process

Task is to refer to C based and RISCV based lab videos and execute the task of compiling the C code using gcc and riscv compiler
C and RISC-V Based Labs

This repository demonstrates the processes involved in compiling C programs and generating assembly code using both a standard GCC compiler and a RISC-V GCC compiler. It includes comprehensive steps and explanations to guide users through each stage of the compilation and debugging workflow.

C Language-Based Lab

Steps to Compile a .c File on Your Machine:

1.Open the bash terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your file.
2.Use the following command to create and edit a new .c file:
